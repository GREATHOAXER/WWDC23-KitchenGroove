## ðŸ“œ About 'Kitchen Groove'
'Kitchen Groove' is designed to provide users with a unique and playful way of interacting with music, using tools that are commonly found in a kitchen. The combination of SwiftUI and AVFoundation technologies enables users to create their own personalized sound effects and enjoy a fun and interactive musical experience.

The main goal of the app is to create an interactive experience where users can play with music and sound as if they are using their hands to touch and manipulate the sound.

## ðŸ›  Features
'Kitchen Groove' is an iPhone app that allows users to play music using kitchen tools such as a zipper bag or a frying pan. The app has four different tools that users can use to create unique sound effects:

- Mixer: This tool allows users to adjust the pitch of the music to create a DJ-like effect.
- Frying pan: This tool simulates the sound of sizzling frying pan to add a lively effect to the music.
- Salt shaker: This tool adds the effect of sprinkling salt on the music to make it sound more flavorful.
- Zipper bag: This tool increases the bass sound of the music by simulating the effect of putting the music in a zipper bag.
